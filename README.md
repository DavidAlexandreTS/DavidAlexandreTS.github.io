## Projects
### Cervical Cancer Risk Factors
[GitHub](https://github.com/DavidAlexandreTS/Cervical-Cancer-Data-Science)

The goal was to identify and evaluate the most significant risk factors contributing to cervical cancer, using **Python**, statistical methods and predictive modeling. By doing so, the project supports early detection strategies and potential public health interventions.
An interesting aspect of cervical cancer risk factors is the correlation between diagnosis and the Schiller test. During colposcopy, a positive Schiller test reveals light yellow-orange areas where iodine isn't absorbed, highlighting abnormal cervical tissue. Normal epithelium stains dark brown with Lugol’s solution. This contrast helps identify potential lesions early.

### Marking and Monitoring Area of Interest
[GitHub](https://github.com/DavidAlexandreTS/area-of-interest-marking-and-monitoring)

The system allows a user to define a custom Area of Interest (AoI) directly on the screen (via mouse input). Once the area is marked, the tool continuously monitors the video feed and automatically detects and alerts when a person enters the defined region.
This solution was designed with practical applications in security, surveillance, and restricted zone monitoring, combining real-time video processing and human detection.
The project was build in **Python** using **Yolov5** and **OpenCV**.
